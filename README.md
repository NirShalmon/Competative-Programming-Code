# Competative-Programming-Code
A partial collection of my algorithm imlementations and solutions for competative programming tasks.
The following list contains a more complete(although still partial) list of IOI problems that I solved: https://wcipeg.com/user/nirshalmon

**IMPORTANT NOTE: All code in this repository was written in a competition(or for a competition), with code correctness and programming time being the top priority. Thus, THE READABILITY AND GENERAL CODE QUALITY IN THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT INDICATIVE OF MY USUAL CODE QUAILITY**
